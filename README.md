# ScreeningApplication

## Introduction
This project was done following the MVVM Design Patterns.
The network calls were made using the Retrofit Library with GSON and RxJava Adapter. I used RxJava instead of the inbuilt retrofit call back for increased efficientcy.
The imaging library used is Picasso. I chose this to reduce the boiler plate code and the inbuilt caching mechanism it provides.
The main display for this application was done using the Recycler View and the Card Layout for a rich and pleasing UI.

### Issue with testing works on another device but not on my own. My Android Studio was recently updated and the other machine has an older version.
